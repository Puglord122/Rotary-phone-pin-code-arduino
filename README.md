# Rotary-phone-pin-code-arduino
Code for my arduino uno rotary phone lock, I wanted to do this project but found other resources online insufficent for completing this with minimal to no modifications to the phone, i created this in the hopes of helping those also wanting to do this without destroying a phone as such feel free to use this and modify my code to fit your needs                                                                                                                                                              A  Also be sure to check out my friends github at https://github.com/compsup/AL5D-Robot-Arm to see cool stuff with a robot arm including using part of this code to control the arm with the phone, will update to add youtube link when finished                                                                                                     Happy programing! -Jake
